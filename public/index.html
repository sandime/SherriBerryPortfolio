				<h5><strong>writer, app maker, journalist<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
Yep. I left newspapers and went to coding bootcamp. That’s a story I have yet to tell. I will, though.
<br><br>
I ended up teaching myself much of everything.

I owe big thanks to FreeCodeCamp, Bossable, Accio Code, Google Developers, Khan Academy,
egghead.io, Quentin Watt, scotch.io
and many other awesome tutorials on the Internet.
<a href="https://scotch.io/"> Scotch.io's</a> MEAN Machine is one of the best books
on the MEAN fullstack out there. I went by the book, step by step.
<br><br>
I plan to launch a couple of apps this year, or at least one. I’m still learning.
There is sooooo much to learn, and there are so many ideas.
<br><br>
My career as a journalist went like this: As solo mother of a toddler,
without a journalism degree (you don’t need one)
and working at Starbucks and a pathologists’ lab, I pitched an Internet column to a business weekly
right when the now-famous Internet was taking off.
I got the gig at the Las Vegas Business Press,
writing about ISPs and Internet companies, first working as a freelancer,
and then as a big-time, full-time reporter.
As my daughter was about to turn five, I had reservations about raising her in Las Vegas,
Crazy Girls billboards, slot machines in grocery stores and all that.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
<p>After attending a conference for business journalists,
	I met an editor who had an opening at the Orange County Business Journal
	in California (note to aspiring journalists, business journalism pays much better).
I took the job and spent about a year there before following a boyfriend (ugh)
	to St. Paul, Minnesota, where I got a job as a tech reporter at the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
After 3.5 years there, I went back to the Orange County Business Journal,
	where I happily worked for many years.
    <br><br>
In my later years at the OCBJ, I freelanced and, as got into skateboarding,
I became marketing assistant for the International Association of Skateboarding Companies.
	My daughter and I even got our pictures skateboarding in the New York Times.
    <br><br>
I had stories published in More magazine, Bust, Hemispheres, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal and other publications.
<br><br>
More than a decade later, my former Las Vegas Business Press editor,
landed at the Orange County Register.
We met for lunch, and he told me about how the OC Register, where he was an editor,
was on a mission to revive not only the newspaper, which had emerged from bankruptcy,
but also the newspaper business. It sounded exciting. I decided to interview.
The boss man didn’t like me (I don’t interview well),
but I got the job, and he learned to like me because I’m a workhorse, and I was pretty good at my job.
<br><br>
I later became an editor for Orange County Register’s university sections.
But my fun was soon over. The OCR owners weren’t being financially responsible,
and the company was clearly going down.
Bad news almost every day. Horrible morale.
Promotions without raises -- that's the telltale sign.
<br><br>
I knew it was time for a change - the newspaper went bankrupt shortly after I left.
I signed up for a three-month coding boot camp (I was once a COBOL programmer, so it makes a little sense).
<br><br>

These days, I'm working on my apps, hogging up all of the free tutorials and taking
classes on Coursera.
I hope to combine storytelling and app development and eventually make money selling my apps.</p>
