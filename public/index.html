				<h5><strong>writer, app maker, journalist<br></strong></h5>
				<p> App maker, writer, journalist.

Yep. I left newspapers and went to coding bootcamp. That’s a story I have yet to tell. I will, though.

I ended up teaching myself much of everything. I owe big thanks to Bossable, Accio Code, Google Developers, Khan Academy, egghead.io, Quentin Watt,  scotch.io and many other awesome tutorials on the Internet. I plan to launch two apps next year, or at least one. I’m still learning. There is sooooo much to learn.

My career as a journalist went like this: As solo mother of a toddler, without a journalism degree (you don’t need one) and working at Starbucks and a pathologists’ lab, I pitched an Internet column right when the now-famous Internet was taking off. I got the gig at the Las Vegas Business Press, writing about ISPs and Internet companies, first working as a freelancer, and then as a big-time, full-time reporter.

As my daughter was about to turn five, I had reservations about raising her in Las Vegas, Crazy Girls billboards, slot machines in grocery stores and all that.   </p>

<p>After attending a conference for business journalists, I met an editor who had an opening at the Orange County Business Journal in California (note to aspiring journalists, business journalism pays much better).

    I took the job and spent about a year there before following a boyfriend (ugh) to St. Paul, Minnesota, where I got a job as a tech reporter at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. After 3.5 years there, I went back to the Orange County Business Journal, where I happily worked for many years. In the later years, I was a freelancer at the OCBJ and while taking up a new hobby of skateboarding, I was a marketing assistant for the International Association of Skateboarding Companies. I also had stories published in More magazine, Bust, Hemispheres, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal and other publications.

    More than a decade after I was hired at the Las Vegas Business Press, my then editor had landed at the Orange County Register. We met for lunch, and he told me about how the OC Register, where he was now an editor, was on a mission to revive not only the newspaper, which had emerged from bankruptcy, but also the newspaper business. It sounded exciting. I decided to interview. The bossman didn’t like me (I don’t interview well), but I got the job, and he learned to like me because I’m a workhorse, and I was pretty good at my job.

    I later became an editor for Orange County Register’s university sections. But the OCR owners weren’t being financially responsible and the company was clearly going down. Bad news almost every day. Promotions without raises. I knew it was time for a change. I signed up for a three-month coding boot camp (I was once a COBOL programmer), and I gave my two-weeks notice.

    During my time at the Register, I finished writing my children’s book. I tried to get it published. I sent it out to two publishers and received one very kind rejection letter. Eventually, I will get to revising the manuscript. I’ve got a lot of writing projects in the works, but not near finished.

    These days, I’m mostly working on my apps. I hope to combine storytelling and app development and eventually make money selling my apps.</p>
